What's a Motive behind this project??
->I build this project to get rid of problem that surrounds around spilitwise payment
around us.

Implementation of spilitwise Algorithm
*Used Hashmap to store Person and total amount he/she credited and debited
*After that i used multiset using two pointer right and left to settle the amount and
then if amount hadn't been settled yet then we again add that to the multiset
                           orr
*we can use maxheap for debit of each person and maxheap for credit of each person and then try to settle the amount

Implementation of spilitwise Algorithm in project
*used javascript for heap implementation 
*using DOM manipulation ,i was able to transpire the required changes on the each 
person
